/*
The switch Statement
Your robot can recognize your emotions marked with number that represents each of them:
1 - You are happy!
2 - You are sad!
3 - You are angry!
4 - You are surprised!
Write a program that takes the emotion number as input and outputs the corresponding message in given format.
If the input is an emotion that the program doesnâ€™t know, it should output: "Unknown emotion.".
Sample input
1

Sample output
You are happy!
