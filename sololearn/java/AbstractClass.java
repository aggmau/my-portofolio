/*
Abstract Classes

A board game company creates new board games every year. 
While all the games have different rules, they also are all similar in that they each have a name and a play() method.
We need to create 3 different games - Monopoly, Chess and Battleships. 
In the play() method Monopoly should print “Buy all property.”, Battleships - “Sink all ships.”, and Chess - “Kill the enemy king.”
Complete the code by implementing the getName() and play() methods inherited from abstract Game class.
