/*
Class Attributes

You are the administrator of a hotel and must create customer information cards for your new customers. 
On the card, you must note the customerâ€™s first and last name, age, and room number.
The program you are given takes a guest's data (first name, last name, age, and room number) as input.
Complete the class by adding corresponding attributes so that the saveCustomerInfo() method works correctly. 
Also assign taken data values to attributes of created object.

Sample Input
John
Smith
35
204

Sample Output
First name: John
Second name: Smith
Age: 35
Room number: 204
