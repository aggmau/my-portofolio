/*
Constructors

Your friend is a cashier at a movie theater. 
He knows that you are an awesome java developer so he asked you to help him out 
and create a program that gets movie title, row, and seat information and prints out a new ticket.
Complete the existing code by adding a constructor to Ticket class so that it can be correctly initialized.

Sample Input
Jaws
5
1

Sample Output
Movie: Jaws
Row: 5
Seat: 1
